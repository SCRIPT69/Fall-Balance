# "Fall Balance" unity mobile game
This is unity game “Fall Balance” for mobiles, in which you control the ball with appropriate physic.

In the first scene your goal is to stay on the rotating platform while obstacles are flying at you, trying to slow you back, and the enemy is trying to knock you down, but you don’t let them. Don’t you stop moving and don’t you ever look behind you. There’s nothing for you behind you. All that exists is what’s on top.

In the second scene your goal is to get to the finish line after passing all the obstacles faster than the others. At first I wanted to make bots that would move to the finish line with you, but then I decided to leave the map empty, as a liminal space, on a map designed for 30 people, only you are there, alone, and not because I don’t know how to make NavMesh pass moving platforms.

And in the both scenes you can not officially win or lose, only you define it. Again, I did this in order to demonstrate a deep metaphor for life, where you can not officially win or lose, and not because I abandon this project.

And there is also a scene with a minimalistic start menu.
